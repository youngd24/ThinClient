# Wyse 7000 Series

## Overview

The Dell Wyse 7000 series consists of the 7010 and 7020 model. They are virtually the
same with differences in the video capabilities they come with. Details are available
here: https://www.dell.com/ae/business/p/wyse-z-class/pd.

They're also referred to as the "z class" thin clients, the one I have examined is a
Zx0 unit.
